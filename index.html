    <h1>Welcome to OPIDF</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>Open Platform Irish Dancing Federation (OPIDF)</strong> was established in 2018 
        by a group of innovative and forward-thinking professional dance teachers.  
        Our primary aim is to promote and advance the teaching of Irish dancing, 
        providing dancers with a platform to showcase their talents in a fun, fair and friendly environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        We host Grade, Championship, National, and World Championship Irish dancing events 
        that teachers, dancers, and families love.  
        OPIDF events are more than just a weekend of dancing and competing — 
        they are memorable, rewarding and positive experiences for all involved.
